Gomoku game with alpha-beta pruning

Horrible shit I wrote when I was 18. Have a look at the "threadpool" implementation and laugh at me haha.

Doesn't perform very well at all (can only achieve a search depth of 4 IIRC) thanks to the very expensive "heuristics" function.
If you care to fiddle with the code, you will find the "heuristics" function can function as a retarded AI by itself (!!!)

Seriously, don't take any code you see as guideline on how to write a Gomoku AI or how to do C programming in general.
